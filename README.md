# Kronborg-Castle-VR
## Description

Kronborg Castle VR app is a project that I was working on while attending course named Computer Graphics on my faculty. 

The project consisted of making a model of the building in Blender and developing the Android app in Unity. 
Tasks for the app were to use image recognition, make a UI, and to have three additional 3D objects related to the theme, with on click events that displayed different content. On click events I used in this app are playing audio, playing video and displaying pictures and text.
