# Kronborg-Castle-VR
## Description

Kronborg Castle VR app is a project that I was working on while attending course named Computer Graphics on my faculty. 

The project consisted of making a model of the building in Blender and developing the Android app in Unity. 
For the app, the tasks were to use image recognition, make a UI, and to place three additional 3D objects related to the theme, with on click events that displayed different content. In this app I used pictures, text, audio and video.
